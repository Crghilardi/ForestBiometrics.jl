This package was inspired by its R counterpart, the [lmfor package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lmfor) with the addition of equations from the western US. For more info on lmfor, please see http://cs.uef.fi/~lamehtat/rcodes.htm

This package defines a number of forestry domain specific equations and functions to allow users to quickly begin solving problems in the Julia language.

## Constants
This package exports a `const K = 0.005454154`to convert between diameter squared in square inches to square feet and `const KMETRIC = 0.00007854` to convert diameter squared in centimeters to square meters when using metric units.
