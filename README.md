# ForestBiometrics.jl
A library for various forest mensuration and biometrics functions in Julia


ForestBiometrics.jl is a package for working with forest measurements data and growth and yield modeling.
This package was inspired by its R counterpart, the [lmfor package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lmfor) with the addition of equations from the western US. For more info on lmfor, please see http://cs.uef.fi/~lamehtat/rcodes.htm

It is my hope that the package not only ports existing functionality from other langauges, but also showcases the abilities of Julia as a programming languages and how concepts like multiple dispatch and metaprogramming can be used to solve domain-specific problems.
