# ForestBiometrics.jl
A library for various forest mensuration and biometrics functions in Julia


ForestBiometrics.jl is a package for working with forest measurements data and growth and yield modeling. 

It is my hope that the package not only ports existing functionality from other langauges, but also showcases the abilities of Julia as a programming languages and how concepts like multiple dispatch and metaprogramming can be used to solve domain-specific problems.
